There is a file on Ubuntu (and pretty much all Debian based Linux systems) that
has a list of the repositories that operating system can download new packages
from.  This file is used by all the package downloaing tools like apt and
synaptic.  I've added a comment inside of this file that has a base64 encoded
flag in it.
