Mike and I often play Dungeons and Dragons together over the phone.  When we
have to do a dice roll though, Mike doesn't trust that I will tell him the
real dice roll and that I will lie.  So he made this program on our server
that will create a random dice roll for us.  I just run his program called
roll_dice and it will give me a random roll, plus it logs what the roll was
so he can tell if someone is cheating.

But since it's the 80s, and cybersecurity really hasn't been invented yet,
I bet it's not very secure.  Figure out how he can tell if I cheat or not.
