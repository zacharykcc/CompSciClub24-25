Turn around
Look at what you see
In her face
The mirror of your dream
Make believe I'm everywhere
Given in the light
Written on the pages is
The answer to our never ending story, ah
Reach the stars
Fly a fantasy
Dream a dream
And what you see will be
Rhymes that keep their secrets will
Unfold behind the clouds
And there upon a rainbow is
The answer to our never ending story, ah
Story, ah
